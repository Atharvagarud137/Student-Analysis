# Student Result Analysis

## Aim
This project uses machine learning to analyze student results.

## Problem Statement
This project uses machine learning to analyze the effect of various factors on the student's results. This could be used to help students improve their performance or identify students at risk of failing.

## Data Set
The data set for this project is a collection of student results from a university. The data set includes the following features:

* Gender
* EthnicGroup
* Parent's Educational qualification
* Type of lunch provided at the school
* Preparation done by the students for the test
* Marital Status of the parents
* Sports that the student practices
* Whether the student is the first child or not
* Number of siblings of the student
* Means of transport used by the student to reach the school
* Number of hours that the student studies (per week)
* Score in math test
* Score on the reading test
* Score in writing test

## Pre-processing
The data set was pre-processed to remove any missing values or outliers. The data were also normalized to improve the performance of the machine learning models.

## Results
The machine learning models could analyze the effect of various factors on the math, reading and writing scores of the student.

## Future Work
This project could be extended in several ways. For example, the data set could be expanded to include more features or the machine learning models could be trained on a different dataset.
